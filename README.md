# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to use Javascript and HTML to put together a cohesive website on UFO sightings. Using given data of reported UFO sightings I was able to make a Website that can filter UFO sightings based on Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Results

Upon arriving to the website, This is what you will see.

You will just need to put in a corresponding filter in each section, or just one section, and press enter. Doing this will filter the results based on the inputed search.

## Summary

While this is a perfectly acceptable and functioning website, there could always be room for improvement. One key drawback is that everything needs to be spelled perfectly and in the right character case. Another element that could be improved is that we could have keyword testimonal search filters as well. In any case, whoever uses this site should have no problem navigating it.
